Some notes on the making-of the actual article.





== To do

Given the possible pairs from the Poloniex exchange:

* Generate the diagram with all possible arbitrage sequences -- This
  will be a very big diagram.

* Generate the diagram will all arbitrage sequences of length three or
  longer -- This will be, hopefully, a visually appealing diagram.

Generate main diagram.

In a concrete case like the https://poloniex.com/[Poloniex exchange]
many arbitrage sequences are of length two.

Given the set of all possible pairs, retain only the pairs for which
there are sequences of size longer than two.
